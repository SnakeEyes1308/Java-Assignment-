This code provides a class named RationalNumber that represents rational numbers and provides some operations on them, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The class includes the following methods:

add(): adds two rational numbers.
subtract(): subtracts two rational numbers.
multiply(): multiplies two rational numbers.
divide(): divides two rational numbers.
equals(): checks if two rational numbers are equal.
toDouble(): converts a rational number to a double.
abs(): gets the absolute value of a rational number.
The class also includes a constructor that takes two integers as the numerator and the denominator of the rational number. It automatically simplifies the rational number by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. If the denominator is zero, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

In the main method of the As7 class, two rational numbers are created based on the command-line arguments. Then, the program prints the two rational numbers. If a fifth argument is provided, it executes one of the four arithmetic operations on the two rational numbers based on the fifth argument. If the fifth argument is not provided, it does not execute any operation.

To execute a single function out of many, the user can uncomment the if-else block at the end of the main method and modify it to call the desired function based on the fifth command-line argument. For example, to perform the addition operation, the user can call the add() method and print the result. The same goes for the other arithmetic operations.
