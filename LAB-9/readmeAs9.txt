This code demonstrates how to use Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to interact with a MySQL database. It connects to a local MySQL database, inserts a new record into the 'student_jdbc' table, updates an existing record, and displays the contents of the 'student_jdbc' table.

The code requires the MySQL JDBC driver to be installed and added to the classpath. The driver can be downloaded from the MySQL website.

To run the code, compile the Java file and execute the resulting class file. Ensure that the MySQL database is running and that the database credentials in the code are correct.

Note that the code is written to work with a specific table and database schema, and may need to be modified to work with different tables or database structures.

Also, note that this code is for demonstration purposes only and does not include any error handling or security measures. When using JDBC, it is important to ensure that proper error handling and security measures are implemented to protect against SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
