Closest Numbers
This program finds the closest pair of numbers and the index of the first number in the pair in an array of integers.

Usage
To use the program, run the ClosestNumbers class in your Java environment.

You will be prompted to enter the number of elements in the array, followed by the elements themselves.

The program will then sort the array in ascending order and find the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers.

Finally, the program will output the closest pair of numbers and the index of the first number in the pair.

Algorithm
The program first sorts the input array in ascending order.

It then iterates through the array and compares the absolute difference between each element and its neighbor.

The program keeps track of the minimum difference found and the index of the first number in the pair with that difference.

After the iteration is complete, the program returns the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers.

Code Overview:
This Java code defines a class named ClosestNumbers, which contains two methods - main and findClosestNumbers. The main method is the entry point of the program, which first prompts the user to enter the number of elements in an array, and then the elements of the array. It then sorts the array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort method and calls the findClosestNumbers method to find the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers. Finally, it prints the closest pair of numbers and their index.

The findClosestNumbers method takes an integer array as input and returns the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers. It iterates through the array and compares each number with its neighbor, updating the minimum difference and the index if a smaller difference is found. It then returns the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers.

Method 1: main
This method is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter the number of elements in an array and the elements themselves. Then it sorts the array in ascending order and calls the findClosestNumbers method to find the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers. Finally, it prints the closest pair of numbers and their index.

Method 2: findClosestNumbers
This method takes an integer array as input and returns the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers. It initializes the minimum difference and the index to the first two elements in the array. It then iterates through the array and compares each number with its neighbor, updating the minimum difference and the index if a smaller difference is found. Finally, it returns the index of the first number in the closest pair of numbers.
